To use this plugin, put it in your ~/.vim/plugin directory. It has no external dependencies.

It's used to edit '.leaves' files. Internally, they have a number of pages, separated
===
like this. Each page is limited to a fixed-size width and height.

Settings you can change in your .vimrc:
    g:leaf_separator (default: '==='): Change the leaf separator
    g:leaf_size (default: 'letter'): Choose a standard paper size to target.
    g:leaf_maxcols (default: none)
    g:leaf_maxrows (default: none): Manually set a size. If you're using a paper size not listed, please open an issue on github with the font, paper type, and what size you've found works, and I'll add it.
